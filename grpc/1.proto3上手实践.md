# Protocol Buffer Basics: Go

This tutorial provides a basic Go programmer's introduction to working with protocol buffers, using the [proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) version of the protocol buffers language. By walking through creating a simple example application, it shows you how to

- Define message formats in a `.proto` file.
> 定义消息格式

- Use the protocol buffer compiler.
> 编译

- Use the Go protocol buffer API to write and read messages.
> 使用生成文件里的API进行编码解码

## Defining your protocol format
> 你得先有一个proto文件定义消息结构

To create your address book application, you'll need to start with a `.proto` file. The definitions in a `.proto` file are simple: you add a *message* for each data structure you want to serialize, then specify a name and a type for each field in the message. In our example, the `.proto` file that defines the messages is [addressbook.proto](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/examples/addressbook.proto).

The `.proto` file starts with a package declaration, which helps to prevent naming conflicts between different projects.
> 包的声明可以避免不同项目之间的冲突

```go
syntax = "proto3";
package tutorial;

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";
```

The `go_package` option defines the import path of the package which will contain all the generated code for this file. The Go package name will be the last path component of the import path. For example, our example will use a package name of "tutorialpb".

```go
option go_package = "github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/examples/go/tutorialpb";
```

Next, you have your message definitions. A message is just an aggregate containing a set of typed fields. Many standard simple data types are available as field types, including `bool`, `int32`, `float`, `double`, and `string`. You can also add further structure to your messages by using other message types as field types.
> 你可以定义各式各样的字段，配置类型和属性

```go
message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2;  // Unique ID number for this person.
  string email = 3;

  enum PhoneType {
    MOBILE = 0;
    HOME = 1;
    WORK = 2;
  }

  message PhoneNumber {
    string number = 1;
    PhoneType type = 2;
  }

  repeated PhoneNumber phones = 4;

  google.protobuf.Timestamp last_updated = 5;
}

// Our address book file is just one of these.
message AddressBook {
  repeated Person people = 1;
}
```

In the above example, the `Person` message contains `PhoneNumber` messages, while the `AddressBook` message contains `Person` messages. You can even define message types nested inside other messages – as you can see, the `PhoneNumber` type is defined inside `Person`. You can also define `enum` types if you want one of your fields to have one of a predefined list of values – here you want to specify that a phone number can be one of `MOBILE`, `HOME`, or `WORK`.
> 消息可以嵌套，你也可以整个枚举

The " = 1", " = 2" markers on each element identify the unique "tag" that field uses in the binary encoding. Tag numbers 1-15 require one less byte to encode than higher numbers, so as an optimization you can decide to use those tags for the commonly used or repeated elements, leaving tags 16 and higher for less-commonly used optional elements. Each element in a repeated field requires re-encoding the tag number, so repeated fields are particularly good candidates for this optimization.
> 后边的数字标注是每个字段的唯一标识

If a field value isn't set, a **default value** is used: zero for numeric types, the empty string for strings, false for bools. For embedded messages, the default value is always the "default instance" or "prototype" of the message, which has none of its fields set. Calling the accessor to get the value of a field which has not been explicitly set always returns that field's default value.
> 字段如果不赋值就会使用默认值

If a field is `repeated`, the field may be repeated any number of times (including zero). The order of the repeated values will be preserved in the protocol buffer. Think of repeated fields as dynamically sized arrays.
> 字段如果标示了**repeated**就可以重复出现多次(或者没有)，就跟数组差不多

## Compiling your protocol buffers

Now that you have a `.proto`, the next thing you need to do is generate the classes you'll need to read and write `AddressBook` (and hence `Person` and `PhoneNumber`) messages. To do this, you need to run the protocol buffer compiler `protoc` on your `.proto`:

1. If you haven't installed the compiler, [download the package](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads) and follow the instructions in the README.
> 先下载protoc编译器，不能科学上网可以直接去github的release上直接下编译好的

2. Run the following command to install the Go protocol buffers plugin:
> 再整一个golang对应的包

```shell
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
```

The compiler plugin protoc-gen-go will be installed in```$GOBIN```, defaulting to. It must be in your ```$PATH```  for the protocol compiler protoc to find it.

3. Now run the compiler, specifying the source directory (where your application's source code lives – the current directory is used if you don't provide a value), the destination directory (where you want the generated code to go; often the same as ```$SRC_DIR```), and the path to your .proto. In this case, you would invoke:
> 指定输入输出路径

```
protoc -I=$SRC_DIR --go_out=$DST_DIR $SRC_DIR/addressbook.proto
```

Because you want Go code, you use the --go_out option – similar options are provided for other supported languages.
> golang使用--go_out选项，其他语言有各自对应的选项

This generates `github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/examples/go/tutorialpb/addressbook.pb.go` in your specified destination directory.
> 最后会在指定的目录生成包含结构和方法的go文件

## The Protocol Buffer API

Generating `addressbook.pb.go` gives you the following useful types:

- An `AddressBook` structure with a `People` field.
- A `Person` structure with fields for `Name`, `Id`, `Email` and `Phones`.
- A `Person_PhoneNumber` structure, with fields for `Number` and `Type`.
- The type `Person_PhoneType` and a value defined for each value in the `Person.PhoneType` enum.

You can read more about the details of exactly what's generated in the [Go Generated Code guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go-generated), but for the most part you can treat these as perfectly ordinary Go types.

Here's an example from the [list_people command's unit tests](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/examples/list_people_test.go) of how you might create an instance of Person:
> 这是如何生成一个Person实例的例子

```golang
p := pb.Person{
        Id:    1234,
        Name:  "John Doe",
        Email: "jdoe@example.com",
        Phones: []*pb.Person_PhoneNumber{
                {Number: "555-4321", Type: pb.Person_HOME},
        },
}
```

## Writing a Message
> 生成消息

The whole purpose of using protocol buffers is to serialize your data so that it can be parsed elsewhere. In Go, you use the `proto` library's **Marshal** function to serialize your protocol buffer data. A pointer to a protocol buffer message's `struct` implements the `proto.Message` interface. Calling `proto.Marshal` returns the protocol buffer, encoded in its wire format. For example, we use this function in the [add_person command](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/examples/add_person.go):

```golang
book := &pb.AddressBook{}
// ...

// Write the new address book back to disk.
out, err := proto.Marshal(book)
if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln("Failed to encode address book:", err)
}
if err := ioutil.WriteFile(fname, out, 0644); err != nil {
        log.Fatalln("Failed to write address book:", err)
}
```

## Reading a Message
> 解析消息

To parse an encoded message, you use the `proto` library's **Unmarshal** function. Calling this parses the data in `buf` as a protocol buffer and places the result in `pb`. So to parse the file in the [list_people command](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/examples/list_people.go), we use:

```golang
// Read the existing address book.
in, err := ioutil.ReadFile(fname)
if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln("Error reading file:", err)
}
book := &pb.AddressBook{}
if err := proto.Unmarshal(in, book); err != nil {
        log.Fatalln("Failed to parse address book:", err)
}
```

## Extending a Protocol Buffer
> 扩展定义的消息

Sooner or later after you release the code that uses your protocol buffer, you will undoubtedly want to "improve" the protocol buffer's definition. If you want your new buffers to be backwards-compatible, and your old buffers to be forward-compatible – and you almost certainly do want this – then there are some rules you need to follow. In the new version of the protocol buffer:
> 向下兼容

- you *must not* change the tag numbers of any existing fields.
> 一定不要修改已经存在的数字标识

- you *may* delete fields.
> 你可以删除字段

- you *may* add new fields but you must use fresh tag numbers (i.e. tag numbers that were never used in this protocol buffer, not even by deleted fields).
> 想加字段可以，数字不要和已存在的冲突了
