# Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation is one of the foundations of database processing. Isolation is the I in the acronym [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid); the isolation level is the setting that fine-tunes the balance between performance and reliability, consistency, and reproducibility of results when multiple transactions are making changes and performing queries at the same time.

`InnoDB` offers all four transaction isolation levels described by the SQL:1992 standard: [`READ UNCOMMITTED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_read-uncommitted), [`READ COMMITTED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_read-committed), [`REPEATABLE READ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_repeatable-read), and [`SERIALIZABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_serializable). The default isolation level for `InnoDB` is [`REPEATABLE READ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_repeatable-read).

A user can change the isolation level for a single session or for all subsequent connections with the [`SET TRANSACTION`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-transaction.html) statement. To set the server's default isolation level for all connections, use the [`--transaction-isolation`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-options.html#option_mysqld_transaction-isolation) option on the command line or in an option file. For detailed information about isolation levels and level-setting syntax, see [Section 13.3.7, “SET TRANSACTION Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/set-transaction.html).

`InnoDB` supports each of the transaction isolation levels described here using different [locking](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking) strategies. You can enforce a high degree of consistency with the default [`REPEATABLE READ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_repeatable-read) level, for operations on crucial data where [ACID](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_acid) compliance is important. Or you can relax the consistency rules with [`READ COMMITTED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_read-committed) or even [`READ UNCOMMITTED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_read-uncommitted), in situations such as bulk reporting where precise consistency and repeatable results are less important than minimizing the amount of overhead for locking. [`SERIALIZABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_serializable) enforces even stricter rules than [`REPEATABLE READ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_repeatable-read), and is used mainly in specialized situations, such as with [XA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_xa) transactions and for troubleshooting issues with concurrency and [deadlocks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock).

> InnoDB使用不同的加锁策略来支持各个隔离界别

The following list describes how MySQL supports the different transaction levels. The list goes from the most commonly used level to the least used.

- `REPEATABLE READ`
  This is the default isolation level for `InnoDB`. [Consistent reads](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_consistent_read) within the same transaction read the [snapshot](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_snapshot) established by the first read. This means that if you issue several plain (nonlocking) [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) statements within the same transaction, these [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) statements are consistent also with respect to each other. See [Section 15.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-consistent-read.html).

  For [locking reads](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_locking_read) ([`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) with `FOR UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE`), [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html), and [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html) statements, locking depends on whether the statement uses a unique index with a unique search condition, or a range-type search condition.

  - For a unique index with a unique search condition, `InnoDB` locks only the index record found, not the [gap](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap) before it.
  - For other search conditions, `InnoDB` locks the index range scanned, using [gap locks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_gap_lock) or [next-key locks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_next_key_lock) to block insertions by other sessions into the gaps covered by the range. For information about gap locks and next-key locks, see [Section 15.7.1, “InnoDB Locking”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locking.html).

- `READ COMMITTED`

  Each consistent read, even within the same transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot. For information about consistent reads, see [Section 15.7.2.3, “Consistent Nonlocking Reads”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-consistent-read.html).

  For locking reads ([`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) with `FOR UPDATE` or `FOR SHARE`), [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) statements, and [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html) statements, `InnoDB` locks only index records, not the gaps before them, and thus permits the free insertion of new records next to locked records. Gap locking is only used for foreign-key constraint checking and duplicate-key checking.

  Because gap locking is disabled, phantom problems may occur, as other sessions can insert new rows into the gaps. For information about phantoms, see [Section 15.7.4, “Phantom Rows”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-next-key-locking.html).

  Only row-based binary logging is supported with the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level. If you use `READ COMMITTED` with [`binlog_format=MIXED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format), the server automatically uses row-based logging.

  Using `READ COMMITTED` has additional effects:

  - For [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) or [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html) statements, `InnoDB` holds locks only for rows that it updates or deletes. Record locks for nonmatching rows are released after MySQL has evaluated the `WHERE` condition. This greatly reduces the probability of deadlocks, but they can still happen.
- For [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) statements, if a row is already locked, `InnoDB` performs a “semi-consistent” read, returning the latest committed version to MySQL so that MySQL can determine whether the row matches the `WHERE` condition of the [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html). If the row matches (must be updated), MySQL reads the row again and this time `InnoDB` either locks it or waits for a lock on it.
  
Consider the following example, beginning with this table:
  
  ```sql
CREATE TABLE t (a INT NOT NULL, b INT) ENGINE = InnoDB;
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,3),(5,2);
COMMIT;
  ```
  
  In this case, the table has no indexes, so searches and index scans use the hidden clustered index for record locking (see [Section 15.6.2.1, “Clustered and Secondary Indexes”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-index-types.html)) rather than indexed columns.
  
  Suppose that one session performs an [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) using these statements:

  ```sql
# Session A
  START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE t SET b = 5 WHERE b = 3;
  ```
  
  Suppose also that a second session performs an [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) by executing these statements following those of the first session:
  
  ```sql
# Session B
  UPDATE t SET b = 4 WHERE b = 2;
```
  
  As [`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html) executes each [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html), it first acquires an exclusive lock for each row, and then determines whether to modify it. If [`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html) does not modify the row, it releases the lock. Otherwise, [`InnoDB`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html) retains the lock until the end of the transaction. This affects transaction processing as follows.
  
  When using the default `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level, the first [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) acquires an x-lock on each row that it reads and does not release any of them:

  ```none
x-lock(1,2); retain x-lock
  x-lock(2,3); update(2,3) to (2,5); retain x-lock
x-lock(3,2); retain x-lock
  x-lock(4,3); update(4,3) to (4,5); retain x-lock
  x-lock(5,2); retain x-lock
  ```
  
  The second [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) blocks as soon as it tries to acquire any locks (because first update has retained locks on all rows), and does not proceed until the first [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) commits or rolls back:
  
  ```none
x-lock(1,2); block and wait for first UPDATE to commit or roll back
  ```

  If `READ COMMITTED` is used instead, the first [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) acquires an x-lock on each row that it reads and releases those for rows that it does not modify:
  
  ```none
x-lock(1,2); unlock(1,2)
  x-lock(2,3); update(2,3) to (2,5); retain x-lock
x-lock(3,2); unlock(3,2)
  x-lock(4,3); update(4,3) to (4,5); retain x-lock
  x-lock(5,2); unlock(5,2)
  ```
  
  For the second `UPDATE`, `InnoDB` does a “semi-consistent” read, returning the latest committed version of each row that it reads to MySQL so that MySQL can determine whether the row matches the `WHERE` condition of the [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html):
  
  ```none
x-lock(1,2); update(1,2) to (1,4); retain x-lock
  x-lock(2,3); unlock(2,3)
x-lock(3,2); update(3,2) to (3,4); retain x-lock
  x-lock(4,3); unlock(4,3)
  x-lock(5,2); update(5,2) to (5,4); retain x-lock
  ```
  
  However, if the `WHERE` condition includes an indexed column, and `InnoDB` uses the index, only the indexed column is considered when taking and retaining record locks. In the following example, the first [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) takes and retains an x-lock on each row where b = 2. The second [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) blocks when it tries to acquire x-locks on the same records, as it also uses the index defined on column b.
  
  ```sql
CREATE TABLE t (a INT NOT NULL, b INT, c INT, INDEX (b)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
  INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,2,3),(2,2,4);
COMMIT;
  
  # Session A
  START TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE t SET b = 3 WHERE b = 2 AND c = 3;
  
  # Session B
  UPDATE t SET b = 4 WHERE b = 2 AND c = 4;
  ```
  
  The `READ COMMITTED` isolation level can be set at startup or changed at runtime. At runtime, it can be set globally for all sessions, or individually per session.
  
- `READ UNCOMMITTED`

  [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) statements are performed in a nonlocking fashion, but a possible earlier version of a row might be used. Thus, using this isolation level, such reads are not consistent. This is also called a [dirty read](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html#glos_dirty_read). Otherwise, this isolation level works like [`READ COMMITTED`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_read-committed).

- `SERIALIZABLE`

  This level is like [`REPEATABLE READ`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-transaction-isolation-levels.html#isolevel_repeatable-read), but `InnoDB` implicitly converts all plain [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) statements to [`SELECT ... FOR SHARE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) if [`autocommit`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) is disabled. If [`autocommit`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) is enabled, the [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) is its own transaction. It therefore is known to be read only and can be serialized if performed as a consistent (nonlocking) read and need not block for other transactions. (To force a plain [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) to block if other transactions have modified the selected rows, disable [`autocommit`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit).)
